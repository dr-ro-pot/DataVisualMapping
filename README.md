# DataVisualMapping
A quick demonstration of visualising data in a Map.
Here using data from census 2022, we have made a map of Chaurjahari Municipality, Rukum West to localise areas where tap water is relatively less common source of drinking water

  The dataset includes data from different nearby local units. Some basic calculations and filtering has also been done to extract data only of the required local unit.
